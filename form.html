    <h3 style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">What is Memorandum of Understanding?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">Memorandum of understanding (MoU), also known as Letter of Intent
        in India, is just a
        means for two parties to
        reach a
        decision. A Memorandum of Understanding or MOU Agreement is entered into when parties have agreed to enter into
        a
        contract, but the formalities (such as terms and conditions) of the contract are yet to be negotiated. It is
        made when
        two or more parties outlining the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement are into initial
        discussions.
        It is used to gauge the intention of the transacting parties before a deal is officially signed between them and
        doesn't
        grant either of them any rights. MOUâ€™s can be kept confidential by the parties, if desired.

        It does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation but, this non-legally binding MOU may be useful to serve
        as an
        agreement between two or more departments within a single public entity.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">Legal validity of MOU in India:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">
        A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation. It is commonly used
        for a
        non-binding contract, that describes the intention of the parties or businesses to work together.

        If an MoU has been drawn for consideration, like for exchange of money, etc., the document would become binding
        on the
        parties, else it is a non-binding contract. The intent of the parties can be deciphered from the contents and
        the
        material provision of the MOU. Clauses such as jurisdiction clause, applicable law, indemnification have binding
        effects
        to the agreement. Thus the legal nature of an MOU rests on the rights, duties, obligations, it creates among
        parties.

        In the Indian legal scenario, nomenclature of an agreement is irrelevant thus simply calling an agreement a
        Memorandum
        of Understanding does not automatically denote that a contract is non-binding.
